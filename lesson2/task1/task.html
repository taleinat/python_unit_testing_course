    So far we've been using self.assertEqual() in our tests to check expected results.
    There are many other such assertion methods available.
    Let's explore them!
</p>
<p>
    The most basic assertion method is assertTrue().
    It is called with a single argument and simply checks whether it is true.
    (It actually checks whether a value is "truthy", i.e. considered true in a boolean context. See details below.)
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to write tests using only assertTrue().
    For example, instead of using assertEqual(a, b), we could use assertTrue(a == b).
    However, using more specific assertions brings many benefits:
    <ul>
        <li>More detailed information upon test failure</li>
        <li>Improved test code readability</li>
        <li>Non-trivial assertions save time and effort</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In this lesson, we'll explore many of the different assertions available.
    Note that you can always look through
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods">
        the full list of available assertion methods
    </a>.

<h3>What does "truthy" mean?</h3>
<p>
    In Python, many values are considered either true or false when in a boolean context,
    e.g. when used as the condition of an "if" statement.
    For example, the integer zero is considered false, while all other integers are considered true.
    Most containers are considered false when empty and true when non-empty.
    You can check whether a value is "truthy" by passing it to the bool() function.
    For example, bool([1,2,3]) == True, and bool([]) == False.
</p>
<h3>Re-using test code</h3>
<p>
    The principles for writing test code are slightly different than when writing "normal" code.
    For example, tests should be written in the most straight-forward manner possible,
    so that what they test and how is as easy to understand as possible. This is so that when
    a test fails, it is easy to figure out what is causing the failure.
</p>
<p>
    To achieve this, it is often better to duplicate some code rather than create abstractions for
    everything. But, of course, it is a bad idea to duplicate large and complex code many times.
    In such cases, the simplest and most useful thing to do is to create helper methods in the
    TestCase class. In the following exercise, you will work with an example of this.
</p>
<h2>Your objective:</h2>
<p>
    Implement the following tests which check the "truthiness" of various values.
    Use only assertTrue and assertFalse.
