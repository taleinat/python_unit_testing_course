# Python Unit Testing Course
An introductory interactive course about unit testing in Python. It is intended to be used with [Pycharm Educational Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/).

*Note: Not yet updated to work with the new version of PyCharm Edu!*

Running this course should be done with Python 3.3 or above, since this uses the `unittest.mock` module which is available only since that version.

This was written for the [Best Interactive Programming Course Contest 2015](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/contest/).
